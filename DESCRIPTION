Description: This package is a general purpose optimisation engine.
    It supports Monte Carlo Optimisation with Metropolis Criterion
    and Acceptance Ratio Annealing on multiple cores, and it supports
    Acceptance Ratio Replica Exchange Monte Carlo Optimisation. In each
    case, the system pseudo-temperature is dynamically adjusted such
    the observed acceptance ratio is very near to the actual
    acceptance ratio.
